# <ins>**Code of Conduct**</ins> 🤝

As members of the Kainos organization, we pledge to:

- Communicate with respect and inclusivity. We value all voices, perspectives, and ideas — they are the backbone of how we build.
- Refrain from using harmful language or behavior. Violations will be taken seriously and addressed with appropriate action.
- Embrace different viewpoints and experiences. As a growing team, people and conversations are our most important assets.
- Accept constructive feedback with openness and humility. Feedback helps us evolve, spot blind spots, and sharpen our craft — together.
- Foster a friendly and collaborative atmosphere. A welcoming space helps us grow as individuals and as a community.
- Respect that **mistakes are part of learning**. Offer help when needed, and avoid blame. Kindness matters — always.
- Adhere to our [style guides](style_guides/) and agreed-upon conventions. Consistency keeps projects **clean**, **readable**, and **fun** to contribute to.
- Take initiative — but also respect boundaries. If you're unsure about something, ask. If you see something broken, try to improve it.
- Celebrate wins — big or small — and support each other when things get tough. We’re not just shipping code, we’re growing together.
